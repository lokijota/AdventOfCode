# Jota's Advent Of Code solutions

Advent of Code challenges, years 2024+. Older solutions are in individual repos until I have patience to migrate.

[2021](https://github.com/lokijota/AdventOfCode2021) - Coded in C#. Made me realize how strict and verbose C# really is.

[2022](https://github.com/lokijota/AdventOfCode2022) - Switch to Python3, and used the opportunity to learn the language.

[2023](https://github.com/lokijota/AdventOfCode2023) - Again coded in Pythom. Couldn't finish all by xmas, and completed the later ones the month before the 2024 edition.

[2024](2024/) - Again going for Python.

[2025](2025/) - Again going for Python. 12 exercises only.
