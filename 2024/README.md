# Advent Of Code 2024

Coding in Python 3.1, in VSCode with Vim (decided to go back to Uni days, because why not)

- **Day 01**: simple challenge, more of a warm-up
- **Day 02**: first part simple, second part just thinking of edge cases confused me. Not pretty code but works.
- **Day 03**: simple challenge with regex. As usual used https://regex101.com/ to test them out.
- **Day 04**: counting XMAS/MAS in a map. First part done in a non-smart but still quick way
- **Day 05**: order pages according to certain rules. First part very simple, used sets and pairwise. Second part slightly harder but the first na√Øve implementation of just swapping order worked well and is very fast. Unexpected.
- **Day 06**: this is the one with the guard walking around a map and finding loops. Second part runs in 8 secs, I'm sure it could be much faster.
- **Day 07**: this is the one where there's a variable number of loops. The second part takes 16 seconds which is too long. I used an `itertools.product` to generate combinations and then just did 3 loops. This is inneficient and means that several computations are repeated for every combination, which is - I think - why it takes so long.
- **Day 08**: Was fearing being slow but ended up not being the case, runs under 0.00x seconds. Using the right data structures made it simple, and used operator.add/sub as parameters to a function to avoid duplicated code. Harder to understand the problem statement than it was to code.
- **Day 09**: file system defrag. Thought about doing something smart with a FAT but ended up just using a np.array and doing it brute force. First part is sub-second, second part 12.5 seconds. Nothing spectacular here.
- **Day 10**: the "smartest" thing here is just using a tuple of 5 elements including the current height, the current coordinates and the position of the 0 that started the trail. This allows to handle the repetitions of part 1 (when it converges in 8 or 9) and replace a set with a list to handle the part 2.
- **Day 11**: happy with this one. Used hashtables to register frequencies of numbers (order is irrelevant), and both parts were solved with the same code in under 0.0x secs.

...

- **Day 24**: This was the binary adder one. Solved it visually using a library to help with visualization, after a lot of data exploration. Frustrated I didn't solve it with code.
- **Day 25**: Trivial, just one part

The hardest one for me this year was probably the robots-pressing-keyboards one. My brain got into inception and it was hard to think about it. In the end it runs fast, even if with too much code.

Also: coding in vscode using **vim**, for old-times sake.
