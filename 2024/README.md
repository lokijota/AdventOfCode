# Advent Of Code 2024

Coding in Python 3.1, in VSCode with Vim (decided to go back to Uni days, because why not)

- Day 01: simple challenge, more of a warm-up
- Day 02: first part simple, second part just thinking of edge cases confused me. Not pretty code but works.
- Day 03: simple challenge with regex
- Day 04: counting XMAS/MAS in a map. First part done in a non-smart but still quick way
